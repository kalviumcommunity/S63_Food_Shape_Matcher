      <br /><br />
      My first-ever project, FoodShapeMatcher, was born during a college assignment called <b>ASAP (As Silly As Possible)</b>. The idea was to craft something unique and fun: a food shape matcher that suggests foods based on shapesâ€”triangles? Think nachos! Circles? Hello, pancakes! While the concept was playful, the process was a serious learning experience that laid the foundation for my technical journey.<br /><br />
      Building FoodShapeMatcher introduced me to the <b>MERN stack</b> (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), where I gained hands-on experience in full-stack web development. I designed the application&apos;s architecture, implemented algorithms to match shapes with foods, and used MongoDB for managing data. Through Express.js and Node.js, I developed a seamless backend to handle requests efficiently, while React.js enabled me to create an interactive and user-friendly interface.<br /><br />
      This project helped me strengthen my skills in API integration, database management, and front-to-backend connectivity, as well as enhance my ability to think creatively about solving user problems. More than just a playful concept, FoodShapeMatcher was my gateway to understanding the intricacies of web development, and it stands as a testament to how I turned a quirky idea into a functional, technically sound application.<br /><br />
